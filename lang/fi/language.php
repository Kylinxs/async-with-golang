/* Note for translators about translation of text ending with punctuation
 *
 * The current list of concerned punctuation can be found in 'lib/init/tra.php'
 * On 2009-03-02, it is: (':', '!', ';', '.', ',', '?')
 * For clarity, we explain here only for colons: ':' but it is the same for the rest
 *
 * Short version: it is not a problem that string "Login:" has no translation. Only "Login" needs to be translated.
 *
 * Technical justification:
 * If a string ending with colon needs translating (like "{tr}Login:{/tr}")
 * then Tiki tries to translate 'Login' and ':' separately.
 * This allows to have only one translation for "{tr}Login{/tr}" and "{tr}Login:{/tr}"
 * and it still allows to translate ":" as " :" for languages that
 * need it (like French)
 * Note: the difference is invisible but " :" has an UTF-8 non-breaking-space, not a regular space, but the UTF-8 equivalent of the HTML &nbsp;.
 * This allows correctly displaying emails and JavaScript messages, not only web pages as would happen with &nbsp;.
